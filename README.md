# Quotex Login App: A Comprehensive Guide for Indian Traders

## What is Quotex?

Quotex is an online trading platform that offers binary options and
digital options trading. Binary options are a type of financial
instrument that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an
asset, such as a currency pair, stock, or commodity. Digital options are
similar to binary options, but they offer more flexibility in terms of
the strike price and expiration time.
